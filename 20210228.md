# Chapter 7

## Key Ideas

* Contour Integration
* Cauchy-Reimann Equations
* Homologous and Homotopic Curves. Homology and Homotopy Classes.
* Power Series from Complex-Smoothness
* Analytic Continuations

## Discussion for Chapter 7

Edwin: Clarification of homologous vs homotpic curves, homotopic for continuous deformation, homology for more general deformation using cancellation (useful for contour integration).

Tangents: classification of types of spaces, what is a topology (set theoretic definition using open sets)? fundamental differences between analysis and algebra, isomorphisms.

## TODO:

Update with notes from one note.
