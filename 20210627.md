# Chapter 9

## Key Ideas

* Laurent Series
* Fourier Transform
* Positive/negative frequencied functions
* Annulus of convergence for laurent series
* Hyperfunctions as a way to connect +ve and -ve frequencied components of a fourier series around some boundry condition.
* Excision theorem
* C^infinity (infinitely differentialble)'s dual is C^-infinity(distributions). C^omega (analytic)'s dual is C^-omega(hyperfunctions).

## Discussion for Chapter 9

Edwin: Explanation for g(p) is kind of hand-wavy, we should define it better. stand-in for alpha_r where r is a specific frequency relative to the fundamental pure tone.

Hyperfunctions as more general forms of distributions.

What is dual space? Intuitively a complement of a space of functions that have certain properties. The dual space if the space of all functionals that when operating on an arbitrary function from a function space will give you a well defined value (complex or real):
