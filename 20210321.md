## Discussion for Chapter 8

Holomorphic functions always lead to conformal mappings (i.e, angle, shape, geometry preservation).

Murtuza: I appreciate how cool the Reimann mapping theorem is although I don't understand intuitively how it works.
Luis: Proof of Riemann mapping theorem isn't straightforward to show.

Murtuza: What's up with the topological equivalence relation that's mentioned for Reimann surfaces: m(complex moduli) - s(complex parameters) = 3g(number of genuses) - 3.

Luis and Edwin: Get the gist, genus isn't enough to classify topology, need these additional params. Don't know about details here which will involve algebraic geometry, topology. Tl;dr genus isn't enough for Reimann surface classification.

Edwin: Reimann surfaces have two properties/structures, topology and complex structure. Found an article that says if you didn't care about the complex structure, knowledge of genus is enough. But to take into account the complex structure, you need to consider moduli, complex params.

Murtuza: What intuitively is the complex structure that is different?

Edwin: In general terms, you can think about he same set of functions being differntialble, holomorphic on the surfaces.

> However, if we are interested in Riemann surfaces
as Riemann surfaces rather than simply as topological
manifolds, then this classification is too crude: it completely ignores the complex structure. We would now
like to refine our classification to remedy this defect.
To this end, we say that two Riemann surfaces X and
Y are (conformally, or holomorphically) equivalent if
there is a topological equivalence between them that
preserves the geometry, i.e., a homeomorphism that

preserves the angles between curves, or takes holomorphic functions to holomorphic functions, or takes
rational functions to rational functions. (These conditions are all equivalent.) Note that we still have at
our disposal our discrete invariantâ€”the genus of a surface. However, as we shall see, this invariant is not fine
enough to distinguish between all inequivalent Riemann surfaces. In fact, it is possible to have families of
inequivalent Riemann surfaces that are parametrized
by continuous parameters (but we cannot make proper
sense of this idea until we have said precisely what is
meant by a family of Riemann surfaces). Thus, the
next step is to fix our discrete invariant and to try to
classify all the different isomorphism classes or Riemann surfaces with the same genus by assembling
them in a natural geometric fashion.
