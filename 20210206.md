# Discussion for Chapter 4

Key Ideas: Convergence/Divergence of series, complex numbers and solutions unlocked by them, mandlebrot set, radius and circle of convergence in the Argand plane.

Murtuza: Pretty pleasant chapter. The point of the power series example for a result that was diverging was that it does not make sense for real numbers right?

Edwin: Think about approximations to functions.

Murtuza: Like Taylor Series? How are they different from Taylor Series.

Luis: Taylor dervied from function, think of the power series as a function in itself. Domain is only valid until the series is divergent. Taylor series is a special type of power series generated from a function itself.

Edwin: Where this is probably going next is introducing the idea of an analytic continuation.

Murtuza: What does 'analytic' mean?

Edwin: Typically that the function has a power series representation. Means infinitely differentiable.

Edwin: Anlytic continuation is the process of extending the domain of a function (typically resembling something like a power series). Tanget: reimann zeta function.
