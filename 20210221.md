# Discussion for Chapter 6

Key Ideas: Definitions of a function, analytic functions, distributions (generalized notion of a function). Numerical methods for integration vs derivatives for well defined functions being easier.

Edwin: We should talk about some related topics. Distributions for instance.

Luis: Distribution as measures. Don't see much difference from probability distributions.

Edwin: c1 => c-infinite for for a function in the complex plane?

Murtuza: Is there a difference between a function that is analytic in the complex plane vs real plane.

Luis: Difference between being real differntialable and complex differentiable.

Edwin: distribution is the generalization of a function, way to define differentials on entities that are not necessarily differentiable.

Luis: This might make more sense from a probabalistic perspective.

Edwin: Some tangents: Fourier transform of function across R -> Distributions (not for all functions, ex: F(1) fourier transform-> dirac delta function), all measures are distribution but not all distributions are measures.

Luis: In terms of probability, think of trying to model some messy probability density function, i.e, figuring out how to describe it by first taking a nicer function like the Guassian and hitting/testing it with test functions (like the phi that Edwin used to generalize the notion of a function for some distribution).
