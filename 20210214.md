# Discussion for Chapter 5

Key Ideas: Exponents and logarithms, complex exponents and logarithms, euler's formula and complex representation with exponents and relation to trignometry/unit circle, Implications for physics, quantum numbers.


Murtuza: Cool stuff, mostly seen this stuff in high school before, esp derivation of trignometric identities using complex exponents as a starting point. Last part about implication for physics was interesting.

Edwin: Logarithms can trip you up though. Problem 5.10 for instance is a tough one.

Edwin: Some of the reframing of stuff you know about, for instance reframing addition/multiplication of complex numbers in terms of translation, rotation was interesting.

Luis: Most important thing here would be to understand complex logarithms. Multiple valuedness for example.

Murtuza: Derivation of i^i for instance blew my mind.

Luis: One thing is phrasing of the complex logarithm funtion as being multi-valued, I think what he means/what is more appropraite to say is there exist multiple versions of the same function.

Murtuza: Why?

Luis: Does not follow the technical definition of a function (specifc domain maps to singular value from range). Better to talk about the functions being onto/trjective.

Tangential discussions: Branches, branch cuts, residue theorem, holomorphic functions, reimann surfaces.
