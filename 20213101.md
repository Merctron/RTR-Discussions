# Discussion for Chapter 3

Stuff that was interesting: Dedekind cut to get to irrationals, setting up natural numbers from the null set and abstracting from there, relation drawn to physical reality at the end.

Edwin: Approach to problem 3.3, set up in terms of ratios and fix the relation with the M, N.

Luis: Would be cool to investigate formally the foundations of math like formal proof for Dedekind cut, related: why is the lebesgue measure (length) of the set of rational number between 0-1 not non-zero? I had this question in undergrad, asked without getting straight answers, later realized this was more profound.

Murtuza: Contiguity is essential?

Luis: If I gave you a collection of random points without continuity, length would make no sense. Now we need countablility. Countably infinite -> natural, intergers, rational numbers. Any countably infinite set has length 0. Uncountably infinite sets have lengths / measures.

Murtuza: How does cardinality factor in?

Luis: That's the question I had. Cardinality has nothing to do with it. Uncountable sets may also have no length. Where does continuity come from since it is what seems to be essential? Turns out this is undecidable (related: axiom of choice, continuum hypothesis).

Unrelated: Formalism vs Platonism?
